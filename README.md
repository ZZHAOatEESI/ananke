# timeclust: Clustering marker gene data by time-series patterns
timeclust is a tool to cluster your marker gene data (such as 16S) by time-series abundance patterns. This creates groups of sequences that have shown the same changes in response to the environment. This tool facilitates the generation of the clusters, and the companion [timeclust-ui](https://github.com/beiko-lab/timeclust-ui) application aids in the exploration of the results.
